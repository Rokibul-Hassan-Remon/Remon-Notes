In our `appsettings.json` file, the normally 
								**logging levels,**
								 **feature flags**, 
								 **external service(Dependency) URLs** 
								 
are typically used to configure different aspects of your ASP.NET application. 


**1.Logging Levels**: 
			**Logging** ---> **Log**  ---> **records** or **message** **generates during its operation** (*active*)
			**logs** are records or messages that an application generates during its operation.
				They provide information about what’s happening inside the app, such as:
					- **`Errors`** or `issues` that occur.
					- **`Warnings`** about potential problems.
					- **`General information`** about normal operations (e.g., when a user logs in).
					- **`Debugging details`** for developers to track down bugs or understand app behavior.
				
					
**Importance of Log**
				 Logs are **helpful** for 
								  **monitoring**,
								  **troubleshooting**,
								  **understanding** ,

# **How the** application **is** performing. 

They are often ` saved ` to **files** or **sent to logging systems** for later review.

In English, the word **"log"** refers to a record or documentation of events, activities, or data. It’s often used to describe a detailed account or list of actions that happen over time.

For example:

- **`Ship's log`**: A **record** of a **ship**'s **journey**.
- **`Activity log`**: A list of **tasks or actions** **someone** has **done**.
- **`App log`**: A **record** of **actions** or events that happen in an **application**.

In general, a "**log**" is a **way** to **keep track** of **what has happened**.

**How to set logs?** `or` **What are debug logs?**
```json
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel":{
				"Default": "Information",
				"Microsoft": "Warning"
	 }
}
```

**2.Feature Flags**: 
				These settings are used to **toggle** specific features `on` or `off` without needing to **redeploy** the application. 
				**They allow for greater flexibility in controlling application behavior.**

   **Feature Flags** (also known as **Feature Toggles**) are a **development technique** used to **enable** or **disable** specific **features** of an application **dynamically**, without having to **redeploy** the **entire application**. They provide a way to control the **visibility** or **functionality** of certain features at **runtime** by simply **adjusting a configuration setting.**

```json
"FeatureFlags": {
				"NewDashboard": false
}
```

- **Toggle Features On or Off**: Feature flags act as switches in the code. Developers or administrators can turn a feature on (enable it) or off (disable it) based on business needs, user testing, or rollout plans.
    
- **No Need for Redeployment**: Instead of updating the codebase and redeploying the application to enable or disable a feature, feature flags allow you to make the change instantly through a configuration update (for example, in a config file or an admin dashboard).

so , if need to **enable** and **disable** for this feature just write this code in **program.cs** file:

```cs
if (builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool>("FeatureFlags:NewDashboard")) {
    
    app.UseNewDashboard();        // Show the new dashboard feature
} else {
    
    app.UseOldDashboard();      // Fallback to the old dashboard
}

```


**3.   External Service URLs**: 
						These settings define the URLs for external APIs or services your application may need to interact with. 
						This could include database servers, third-party APIs, or other microservices.

```json
"ExternalServices": {
					  "WeatherApiUrl": "https://api.weather.com",
					  "PaymentServiceUrl": "https://api.payment.com"
}
```
