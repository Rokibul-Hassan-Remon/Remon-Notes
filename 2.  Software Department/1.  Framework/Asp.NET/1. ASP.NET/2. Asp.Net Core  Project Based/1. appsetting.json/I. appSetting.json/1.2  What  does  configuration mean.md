The phrase **"retrieving configuration values"** refers to the process of accessing and using **settings or data** that are stored in a configuration file or source within an application. These values typically define how the application behaves or connects to external systems, without hard-coding the settings directly into the code.

In ASP.NET Core, **configuration values** are often stored in files like `appsettings.json`, environment variables, or other configuration sources. These values can include things like:

- **Database connection strings** (e.g., how to connect to a database).
- **API keys** or credentials.
- **Application settings** such as logging levels, feature flags, or external service URLs.

### Example of Retrieving Configuration Values:

In ASP.NET Core, the `builder.Configuration` object is used to access these settings.

Hereâ€™s an example of retrieving a **database connection string** from `appsettings.json`:

1. **appsetting.json**:
    ```cs
    {
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass;"
  }
}

```

**Retrieving the configuration value in code**:
```cs
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");

```

In this example, the `GetConnectionString()` method is used to retrieve the **"DefaultConnection"** value from the `ConnectionStrings` section of `appsettings.json`.

### Why This Matters:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Configuration values are stored separately from the application code, making the app more flexible and easier to maintain.
- **Environment-Specific Settings**: You can easily switch configuration values depending on the environment (e.g., different settings for development, staging, and production).
- **Security**: Sensitive information like passwords and API keys can be stored securely in configuration files or environment variables, away from the source code.
