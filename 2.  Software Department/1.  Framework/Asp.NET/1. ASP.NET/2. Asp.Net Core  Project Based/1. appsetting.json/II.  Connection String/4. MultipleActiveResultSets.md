### MultipleActiveResultSets=True

- `What it Does`: Allows **multiple database queries** to `run` at the **same time** on a **single connection**.

- `Why Use It` :  **Needed** when you want to **execute several** commands or `queries` **without opening new connections**.

- `When to Use`: Useful in complex applications where multiple database operations happen at once.

### How MultipleActiveResultSets (MARS) Works

When you enable `MultipleActiveResultSets=True`, 
	it allows multiple commands or queries to be executed on the
					**same database connection** **without having to wait for each one to finish**. 
							
This **doesnâ€™t mean** they **all run at the exact same time**; 
		instead,
				 **it means you can send and manage multiple queries without closing and reopening the connection.**

### Key Points:

1. **Single Connection, Multiple Commands**: With **MARS**, 
												you can use the **same** **database connection object** to `run multiple commands.`
												For example, **while one command is retrieving data, another can be executed** 
												**without waiting.**
    
2. **How It Works Internally**:
    
    - Normally, **if you execute a query** (like reading data from a table), the **connection is** "`busy`" **until the data is fully processed**.
    
    - With MARS enabled, 
					    - **you can start another query while the first is still processing, even though they share the same connection object. The system manages the communication for you.**
    
1. **Scenario Example**:
    
    - If you have a database connection `conn` and 
			    - you run a `SELECT` query to read some data, 
			    - 	
			    - you can still execute another `INSERT` or `UPDATE` command
												    - on the same `conn` **without waiting** for the `SELECT` query to finish.
    
1. **Why It's Useful**:
    
    - Reduces the overhead of opening and closing connections.
    - Improves performance in applications where you need to handle multiple operations close together.

### Important Note:

- MARS is not true parallel execution. The SQL Server still processes commands sequentially under the hood, but MARS handles command management so you don't have to explicitly wait for each one to finish. It's more about flexibility and efficiency in handling commands.
