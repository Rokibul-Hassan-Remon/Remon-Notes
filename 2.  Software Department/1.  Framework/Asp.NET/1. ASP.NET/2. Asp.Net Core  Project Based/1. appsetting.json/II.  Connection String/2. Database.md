```json
	database = project_name 
```

when you do the pet project then you may use project name in this way you can distinguish other databases according to their project name.
### Example: 
##### My project name is : LibraryManagementSystem
###### Then my database = LibraryManagementdb ;
```json
	database = LibraryManagementdb ;
```

that's simple .
