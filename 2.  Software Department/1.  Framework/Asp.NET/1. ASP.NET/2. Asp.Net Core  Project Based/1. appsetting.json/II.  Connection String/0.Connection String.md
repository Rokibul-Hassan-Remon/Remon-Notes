In Asp.NET `appsetting.json` for SQL Server we will use a connection string :
```json
{
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "LibraryMngDbContexts": " server = DESKTOP-Q51BQ3N\\SQLEXPRESS ; database = LibraryMngDb ; Trusted_connection = true ;    MultipleActiveResultSets = true; TrustServerCertificate = true ;" 
  }
},
```


**Step** to **connect** with **SQL**  Server:
1. Set `Server` Name 
2. Give a `Database` Name
3. For **Windows Authentication** use `Trusted_Connection` = `True`
4. To Run multiple Queries one after one without disconnecting to  the database .
		1. `MultipleActiveResultSets` = `True`

5. `TrustServerCertificate` = `Ture`

#### Here may be a question could arise " Why I will write my **ConnectionString** in this manner of follow the way above here is written ?"
##### Ans
When We completed the  installation of  **SSMS** in your device then it showed us something a interface where  it was clearly  mentioned that if you wanna connect  **Visual Studio** with the **SSMS** then you follow this line 
Here I is a screenshot I given below:

It is applicable one and only when we connect with **SSMS** through the **Windows Authentication** 

If we wan to connect through the **Sql Server Authentication** then we 
			must drop **the** `Trusted_Connection=True`  
			and **add** `username=<your user name> password=<your password>`
					
finally it the connection string look  like  this : 

`Server = server = DESKTOP-Q51BQ3N\\SQLEXPRESS ; database = LibraryMngDb ; username=<your user name> password=<your password>` `

```JSON
{
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "LibraryMngDbContexts": " server = DESKTOP-Q51BQ3N\\SQLEXPRESS ; database = LibraryMngDb ; username=<your user name> password=<your password>;" 
  }
},
```


In so many connection string you can see that `Data Source` , `Initial Catalog`which are  nothing new accordingly `Server`. `Database` 
I mean 
							`DataSource` = `Server:`
							`Initial Catalog` = `Database` 
							
So, don't be panic
