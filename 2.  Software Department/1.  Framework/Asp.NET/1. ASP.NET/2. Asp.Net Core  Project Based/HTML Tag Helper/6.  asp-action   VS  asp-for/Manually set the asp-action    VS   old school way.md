When using `asp-action` in ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers, you typically **don't manually write the full URL** like `/Controller/Details` or `/Controller/Create`. Instead, you just specify the **action method name**, and ASP.NET Core will generate the correct URL based on your routing setup. However, in my example, I was showing you the **HTML output** that ASP.NET Core generates when you use `asp-action`.

### How `asp-action` Works:

1. **In Anchor Tags (`<a>`)**:
    
    - You use `asp-action` to generate a URL that points to a specific action method in your controller.
    - The URL is generated based on the routing configuration, not hardcoded.
    
    ### Example:
    ```html
    <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="5">View Details</a>

```

The **Tag Helper** generates an anchor tag that points to the `Details` action in the `Home` controller and includes the route parameter `id=5`. The resulting HTML will be:
```html
<a href="/Home/Details/5">View Details</a>

```

**In Form Tags (`<form>`)**:

- You use `asp-action` to specify the action method where the form should be submitted.

### Example:
```html
<form asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Create" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="Title" />
    <input type="submit" value="Create" />
</form>

```

### This will generate this:
```html
<form action="/Home/Create" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="Title" />
    <input type="submit" value="Create" />
</form>

```

### Key Attributes Used with `asp-action`:

- **`asp-controller`**: Specifies which controller to target. If omitted, the current controller is used.
- **`asp-action`**: Specifies the action method in the controller.
- **`asp-route-*`**: Allows you to specify route parameters (e.g., `asp-route-id="5"`).

### Examples:

#### Anchor Tag (`<a>`) with `asp-action` and `asp-controller`:
```html
<a asp-controller="Products" asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="10">Product Details</a>

```
### This generates:
```html
<a href="/Products/Details/10">Product Details</a>

```


#### Form Tag (`<form>`) with `asp-action`:
```html
<form asp-action="SubmitForm" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="Name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

```
### This generates:
```html
<form asp-action="SubmitForm" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="Name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

```

### Why You Use `asp-action` Instead of Hardcoding URLs:

- **Routing Flexibility**: Using `asp-action` ensures that URLs are dynamically generated based on your routing configuration. This means that if your route templates change (e.g., you use attribute routing or custom route patterns), your links will automatically update.
- **Cleaner and More Maintainable**: You don't have to worry about manually managing URLs in your views.
- **Model Binding and Parameters**: Tag Helpers can automatically bind route parameters, query strings, and other values to the URL, making it more convenient than hardcoding.

### Summary:

- **You use `asp-action` to specify the action method name**, and ASP.NET Core generates the appropriate URL based on the routing configuration.
- **The generated HTML** will include the `href` or `action` attributes, but you don't need to write them manually.
- Using `asp-action` ensures your URLs are clean, flexible, and follow the routing rules.
