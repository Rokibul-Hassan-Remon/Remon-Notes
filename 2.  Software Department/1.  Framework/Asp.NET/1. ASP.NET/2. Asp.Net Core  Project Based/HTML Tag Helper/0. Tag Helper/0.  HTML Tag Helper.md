Tag Helpers are a feature in ASP.NET Core that allow you to create HTML elements with server-side functionality directly in your Razor views. They are designed to make your HTML cleaner and easier to read while also enabling server-side processing.

## Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core simplify the process by directly adding HTML-like syntax in your Razor views, and they generate the appropriate HTML elements with the necessary attributes, just like HTML helpers, but they are more readable and intuitive as they look like standard HTML tags with extra functionality.

### Key Points

- **Syntax**: Tag Helpers use HTML-like syntax, making them intuitive to use. They look like standard HTML tags but with some additional attributes.
- **Built-in Tag Helpers**: ASP.NET Core comes with several built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks (e.g., form inputs, links).

### How to Use Tag Helpers

1. **Enable Tag Helpers**: Ensure your Razor view has the necessary directive at the top. Usually, this is done by including:
```c#
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers

```

2.**Using Tag Helpers**: Replace traditional HTML elements with their Tag Helper equivalents. Here are some examples:

- **Form Submission**:
```c#
<form asp-action="Submit" method="post">
    <input asp-for="Name" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```

- `asp-action` specifies which action method to call when the form is submitted.
- `asp-for` binds the input to a model property.

**Links**:
```c#
<a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">Home</a>

```

**Validation**:
```c#
<span asp-validation-for="Name" class="text-danger"></span>

```

- - - Displays validation messages for the `Name` property of the model.

3. **Custom Tag Helpers**: You can create your own Tag Helpers by creating a class that inherits from `TagHelper`. This allows you to add custom behavior to HTML tags.

### Benefits of Using Tag Helpers

- **Readability**: Makes your Razor views cleaner and easier to read.
- **Intuitive**: You can use familiar HTML syntax while leveraging server-side features.
- **Integration**: They work seamlessly with model binding, validation, and routing.
