**Dependency injection** is a process where the **DI container** --->**gives** the necessary **services** (dependencies) to the **classes** (like controllers) that **need** them. 


# Why Dependency Injection in Constructor ?
   The **constructor injection** is about 
		   - **providing** the **required** **services** (like `MasjidDbContext` ) ---> controller. 
		   - DI resolves the **service(Dependency)** ---> the **registered services(Dependencies)** 
										---> **injects** it into the **controller**.

# Reason behind the DI in constructor 
The **reason** you need to inject the dependency in the constructor is that:

- The **service itself** (like `MasjidDbContext`) needs to be **created** and **provided** to your controller.
- Even though the **configuration** (like the connection string) is stored in `appsettings.json`, you still need to **register the service** (e.g., `MasjidDbContext`) using that configuration.


# Why Dependency Injection ?
In short,
	`appsettings.json` only---> **provides**---> **data** (like connection strings),
       while, **dependency injection** --->**ensures**---> your **controller**---> **gets**---> the **right services** ---> use that **data** (like `DbContext` to interact with the **database**).


### Adv.   Dependency Injection  :
Responsible for providing the registered services to the classes that
						need them, 
						promoting loose coupling and 
						managing the lifecycle of those services.
