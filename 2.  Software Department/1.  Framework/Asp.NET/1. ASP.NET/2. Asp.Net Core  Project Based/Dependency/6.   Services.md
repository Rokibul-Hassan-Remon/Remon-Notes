### Examples of Services(Dependencies):

1. **DbContext**: For database interactions (e.g., `MasjidDbContext`).
2. **Logging Services**: For logging information (e.g., `ILogger`).
3. **Email Services**: For sending emails.
4. **Caching Services**: For caching data.


### Why Are They Called "Services"?
They are called **services** because they **provide** specific **functionality** to **other** **parts** of the **application**.
The **DI** system **manages** the **creation** and **lifetime** of these services.


### Why Services(Dependencies ) Are Useful:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each service is responsible for a specific task.
- **Reusability**: Services can be reused in different parts of the application.
- **Testability**: Services can be mocked and tested independently.
- **Lifecycle management**: The DI container manages the creation, lifetime, and disposal of services efficiently.


In summary, **services are classes** that provide **specific functionality** to your application,
and **DI** makes them available where needed, ensuring 
			**clean code**: `Services separate concerns, keeping code readable and maintainable`
			**modularity**: `breaking down your application into smaller, independent, and interchangeable parts`
						`(modules).` 
			**efficiency**: `DI manages how services are created and reused, ensuring optimal resource usage.`

**services** in **Dependency Injection (DI)** are **not** **static** classes. 
--->They are **regular** classes that the **DI container manages** and
						      --->**provides** to **other** **classes** when **needed**.
