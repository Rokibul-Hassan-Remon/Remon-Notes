the **DbContext** is responsible for:

- Mapping entity classes to database tables and managing relationships.
- Tracking changes to entities and persisting those changes to the database.
- Facilitating the migration process to keep the database schema in sync with the entity classes.

The `DbContext` in **Entity Framework Core** serves as a **bridge** **between** 
your `application` and the `database`. It is **not directly** **responsible** for the
**database schema** itself, but it plays a crucial role in managing the 

**mapping between your application’s entities (Csherp classes) and the database schema.**

### Responsibilities of DbContext:

1. **Configuration**:
    
    - The **DbContext** configures how your application’s entities map to the database tables, columns, relationships, and other database features. This is typically done using the **Fluent API** or data annotations in your entity classes.
2. **Managing Entities**:
    
    - It tracks the changes made to your entities during the lifetime of the application. When you add, update, or delete entities, the **DbContext** keeps track of these changes so that they can be persisted to the database when `SaveChanges()` is called.
3. **Database Schema Updates**:
    
    - While the **DbContext** itself does not create or directly manage the database schema, it facilitates the process through migrations. When you modify your model classes (adding, removing, or changing properties), you use migrations to generate the necessary SQL commands to update the database schema.
    - The `Add-Migration` command creates a migration based on the changes in the **DbContext** and the entity classes, while the `Update-Database` command applies those migrations to the actual database.
4. **Querying Data**:
    
    - The **DbContext** provides a way to query data from the database using LINQ (Language Integrated Query). You can retrieve, filter, and manipulate data through the **DbSet<T>** properties defined in your context.
