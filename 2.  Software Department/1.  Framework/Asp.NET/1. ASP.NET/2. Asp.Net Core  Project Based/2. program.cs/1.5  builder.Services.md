# What actually done by this **Services** line 
####            **"builder.Services.AddDbContext<  Name_of_ the_User_Defined_DbContext >(x => x.UseSqlServer( conn ) )**
# Ans:

###  **builder.Services **

- **Purpose**: It manages **dependency injection** (DI).

- **Usage**: You register your services here, which can then be injected
     into your controllers or other parts of the application.
  **Focus**: Configures services that will be available throughout the application's lifetime.
     
    ```cs
    builder.Services.AddDbContext<  Name_of_ the_User_Defined_DbContext >(x => x.UseSqlServer( conn ) );
```

`builder.Services:`   **focuses on setting up the dependency injection container (service registration).**

These are often used **together**, but their **roles** are **distinct**â€”one manages **DI**, and the other **handles configuration settings.**
