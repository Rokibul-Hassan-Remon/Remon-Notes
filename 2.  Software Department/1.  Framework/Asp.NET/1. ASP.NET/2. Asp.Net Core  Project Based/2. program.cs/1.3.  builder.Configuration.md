## What is Done by This **Configuration** Line:

### Code Example:
```cs
		var conn = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("InventoryManageDb");
```

### Definition of Configuration:

- **Configuration** refers to the arrangement, setup, or settings of components within a system to ensure it functions in a specific way.
    
- It involves deciding how different aspects should be organized, connected, or adjusted to achieve a desired outcome.
    

### Breakdown of **builder.Configuration**:

#### **Purpose**:

- It is responsible for handling **application configuration**.
	

#### **Usage**:

- Accesses and manages configuration settings like:
    
    - Application settings (e.g., `appsettings.json` values).
        
    - Connection strings.
        
    - Environment variables.
        

#### **Example**:

- In the provided code snippet, it retrieves the connection string for the database named **"InventoryManageDb"** from the application's configuration source (e.g., `appsettings.json`).

```cs
// appsettings.json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "InventoryManageDb": "Server=...;Database=...;User Id=...;Password=...;"
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

- `builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("InventoryManageDb")` reads the **connection string** for the database `InventoryManageDb`.
    
- **Purpose**: Ensures the application has the correct database connection details to establish a connection.
    

### Summary:

- `builder.Configuration` focuses on retrieving configuration values required for the application to function properly.
    
- While related to dependency injection (DI) in application setup, **configuration** specifically deals with settings and values, such as connection strings, necessary for the applicationâ€™s environment and functionality.
