### **2. ViewBag**:

- **What it is**: Like a box where you can add things, but this time, you don’t need labels (keys). You just call the data directly.
    
- **How to use**: You just use a property like **ViewBag.Title** to get the data.
    
- **Example**:

```cs
	ViewBag.Title = "Movie List";
```

In the view:

```cs
<h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>
```

- **Pro**: Easier to use. You don’t need to remember labels.
- **Con**: Less strict, so it can sometimes be harder to track what data is being passed.
