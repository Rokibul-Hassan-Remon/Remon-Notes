### **ViewData**:

- **What it is**: Like a box (a dictionary) where you put things inside using labels (keys).
    
- **How to use**: You need to use a label (key) to get the value. You also need to **convert** the value when you use it.
    
- **Example**:
```cs
		ViewData["Title"] = "Movie List";
```
   
In the view:
```cs
		<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
```

- **Pro**: More organized. You know exactly what data you're using.
- **Con**: You need to remember the label and sometimes convert the data.
