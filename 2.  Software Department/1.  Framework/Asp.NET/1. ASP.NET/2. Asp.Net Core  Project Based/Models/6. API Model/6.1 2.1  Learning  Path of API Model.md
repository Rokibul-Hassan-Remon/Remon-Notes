#### What to Learn:

- **Purpose**: API Models define the structure of the data sent to and received from an API. They are used in Web APIs to manage the input and output of data.
- **Where They Fit**: API Models help shape and validate the data that is sent over HTTP (often in JSON format).

#### Learning Path:

1. **Understand API Models and Data Contracts**:
    
    - Learn the difference between **API Models** and other models (like **View Models** and **DTOs**).
    - **Search for**: "What are API Models in ASP.NET Core?"
2. **Create Simple API Models**:
    
    - Practice defining **API Models** for handling requests and responses in your Web API.
    - **Search for**: "Creating API models in ASP.NET Core Web API"
3. **Handle API Request and Response**:
    
    - Learn how to bind incoming data from API requests (e.g., POST requests) to API models and how to return API models in the response.
    - **Search for**: "Handling API requests and responses in ASP.NET Core"
4. **Data Annotations for API Models**:
    
    - Add data annotations like `[Required]`, `[Range]`, etc., to API Models to ensure that the data is valid before processing.
    - **Search for**: "Validating API models in ASP.NET Core"
5. **Use API Models with JSON Serialization**:
    
    - Learn how to work with **JSON** and **Data Contracts** using **JSON serialization/deserialization** for API communication.
    - **Search for**: "JSON serialization with API models in ASP.NET Core Web API"
