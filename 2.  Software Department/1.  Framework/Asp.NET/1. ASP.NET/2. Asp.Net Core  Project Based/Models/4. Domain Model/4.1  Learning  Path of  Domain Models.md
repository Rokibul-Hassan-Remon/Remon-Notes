### **Domain Models**

#### What to **Learn**:

- **Purpose**: Domain Models represent your application's core business logic and encapsulate behavior related to your business entities.
- **Where They Fit**: Domain Models often include the business rules and logic, and they are central to **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.
