For a structured approach, it's **best to start with the core concepts of models** before diving into **Entity Framework (EF)**. Here's why:

### 1. **Understand Models First (Data Models and Other Models)**

- **Why**: Models are the foundation of any application, including EF. Understanding **data models**, **view models**, **input models**, etc., helps you structure your application and organize how data flows between the database, UI, and business logic.
- **What to Focus On**:
    - **Data Models**: These represent the structure of your data (i.e., how entities like `Product`, `User`, `Order`, etc., are defined).
    - **Other Models**: View Models, Input Models, and Domain Models help you organize data in different layers of the application (UI, API, business logic).
    - **Why Models Matter**: Learning models will help you know how to define entities and how to map them to your database using **Entity Framework**.
- **Learning Focus**:
    - Creating simple classes to represent your data.
    - Defining relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many) between entities.
    - Using data annotations like `[Key]`, `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, etc., for validation.

### 2. **Then Learn Entity Framework (EF)**

- **Why**: Once you have a clear understanding of what models are, you can then apply **EF** to interact with your database through those models.
- **What to Focus On**:
    - **DbContext**: Learn how to configure the database context and work with **DbSet** to interact with your models.
    - **Migrations**: Learn how to create and update your database schema based on model changes using migrations.
    - **CRUD Operations**: Learn how to perform **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations using **EF Core**.
- **Learning Focus**:
    - Setting up and configuring EF Core in your project.
    - Using migrations to create/update the database.
    - Writing LINQ queries to interact with data in the database.
- **Search for**: "Entity Framework Core basics" or "EF Core CRUD operations".

### Suggested Learning Path:

1. **Start with Models**: Learn how to create **data models**, **view models**, and understand how they fit in an application.
2. **Learn Entity Framework**: Once you're comfortable with models, dive into EF to see how these models interact with the database.

### Why This Path Works:

- Models are the **structure** of your application. Without understanding them, you may find it hard to effectively use **Entity Framework**, which is responsible for **data persistence** (saving and retrieving data from the database).
- By understanding **how models represent data**, you'll better appreciate **how EF Core works to manage database interactions** and map data between your app and the database.

In short:

1. **Learn Models** â†’ 2. **Learn EF** = **Strong foundation in data access and organization**.
