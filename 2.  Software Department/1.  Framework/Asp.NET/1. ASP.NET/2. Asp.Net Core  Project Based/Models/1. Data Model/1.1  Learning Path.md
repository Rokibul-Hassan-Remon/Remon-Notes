### 1. **Strengthen the Basics of Data Models**:

Since you already know the basics, it's important to solidify your understanding of what **Data Models** are and how they work with **Entity Framework** and **SQL**.

- **Topics to Cover**:
    
    - **Basic Data Model Structure**: Learn how to create classes in C# that represent database tables. Understand **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **relationships**.
    - **Entity Framework (EF) Basics**: Learn how EF maps models to the database and how to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    - **Migrations**: Understand how to add and update database schema using EF migrations.
- **Suggested Resources**:
    
    - Watch a beginner-friendly video or read articles about **Entity Framework Core** and **Data Models** (like **CRUD operations**).
    - Example search: **"Entity Framework Core Data Model tutorial for beginners"**.

### 2. **Learn About Model Relationships**:

After grasping the basics, dive into **relationships** between data models such as **one-to-one**, **one-to-many**, and **many-to-many**.

- **Topics to Cover**:
    
    - **Navigation Properties**: How to define relationships in models (e.g., how to represent a one-to-many relationship using `ICollection` or `List`).
    - **Foreign Keys**: How foreign keys work in the context of relationships and how to configure them in **EF**.
- **Suggested Resources**:
    
    - Search for **"Entity Framework Core relationships tutorial"** or **"Data Model relationships in ASP.NET MVC"**.

### 3. **Practice Advanced EF Concepts**:

Once you're comfortable with relationships, start working on more advanced **Entity Framework** topics like **lazy loading**, **eager loading**, **data seeding**, and **custom queries**.

- **Topics to Cover**:
    - **Lazy Loading vs Eager Loading**: How to manage performance when querying data.
    - **Data Seeding**: How to add initial data to the database during migrations.
    - **Custom Queries**: Learn how to write complex queries using LINQ in C#.
- **Suggested Resources**:
    - Look for videos or tutorials about **EF Core advanced querying** or **lazy/eager loading**.
    - Example search: **"Advanced Entity Framework Core querying and optimization"**.

### 4. **Understand the Role of View Models and DTOs**:

Once you're comfortable with **Data Models**, learn how to use **View Models** and **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**, which are often used to transfer data between the **Controller** and **View**.

- **Topics to Cover**:
    
    - **View Models**: Learn how to shape the data in a way that is appropriate for display in your views (e.g., combining multiple models or adding computed fields).
    - **DTOs**: Understand how DTOs are used to transfer data between layers or across systems (especially useful in API scenarios).
- **Suggested Resources**:
    
    - Example search: **"ASP.NET MVC View Model and DTO tutorial"**.

### 5. **Apply Data Models in Real Projects**:

Practical application is key to deepening your understanding. Try building small projects where you can use **Data Models** for various functionalities such as **user registration**, **CRUD operations**, **search functionalities**, etc.

- **Project Ideas**:
    
    - **Blog Application**: Create models for posts, categories, and comments.
    - **E-Commerce System**: Build models for products, orders, and users.
    - **Library Management**: Build models for books, authors, and borrowers.
- **Suggested Resources**:
    
    - Look for project-based tutorials to practice Data Models with **Entity Framework Core**.
    - Example search: **"ASP.NET MVC CRUD project tutorial"** or **"Build an app using Entity Framework Core"**.

### 6. **Learn SQL Basics for Data Models**:

Having a good grasp of **SQL** will help you understand how data is stored and retrieved in a database. Even though Entity Framework hides much of the SQL logic, understanding the SQL queries it generates will be helpful.

- **Topics to Cover**:
    - **Basic SQL Queries**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.
    - **JOIN Operations**: Learn how different tables relate to each other in SQL.
- **Suggested Resources**:
    - Watch or read about basic SQL tutorials or follow a beginner course on SQL.
    - Example search: **"SQL basics for beginners tutorial"** or **"Learn SQL for ASP.NET developers"**.

### 7. **Explore Entity Framework Core Best Practices**:

Learn about best practices for working with **Entity Framework** and **Data Models**, such as handling migrations effectively, writing efficient queries, and optimizing performance.

- **Topics to Cover**:
    
    - **Query Optimization**: Learn how to write efficient LINQ queries.
    - **Handling Migrations**: Understand how to use migrations correctly in production environments.
- **Suggested Resources**:
    
    - Example search: **"Best practices Entity Framework Core"** or **"ASP.NET Core performance optimization with EF"**.
