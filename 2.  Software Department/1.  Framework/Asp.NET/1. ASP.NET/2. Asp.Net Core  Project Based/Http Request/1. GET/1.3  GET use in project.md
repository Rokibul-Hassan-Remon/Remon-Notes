#   What if I don't use   **method**  = "  **post**  "    ??????
```cs
<from asp-action="Create">

    <div class="form-group">
        <label asp-for="Title" class="Control-label"></label>
        <input asp-for="Title" class="form-control" />
    </div>
</from>
```

Yes, it's possible that your form works even without explicitly specifying `method="post"` in the form tag, and here's why:

### Default Form Method is GET

- In HTML, if you don't explicitly specify the `method` attribute in a form tag, the default value is `GET`.
- However, since you have a `Create` action in your controller that likely has two versions (one marked with `[HttpGet]` and one with `[HttpPost]`), ASP.NET Core uses the routing system to handle the request properly.


### Why It Works Without `method="post"`:

1. **ASP.NET Core Convention**:
    
    - By convention, when you submit a form using a button of type `submit` or an `input` element without specifying a form method, the browser sends a `GET` request.
    - However, if you use JavaScript or other mechanisms, the form may trigger a `POST` request depending on how it's handled.


1. **Your Code Specific Case**:
    
    - In your form, you have an `<input type="button" value="Create" class="btn-outline-primary" />`, which is a button of type `button`, **not `submit`**.
    - This means that **this button doesnâ€™t trigger form submission by default**.
    - In ASP.NET, when you eventually trigger form submission through JavaScript or another event, the controller action with `[HttpPost]` will handle it if the method is a `POST` request.
