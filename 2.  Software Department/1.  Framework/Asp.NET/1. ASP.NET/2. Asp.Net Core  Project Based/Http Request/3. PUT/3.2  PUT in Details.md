### **PUT Request**:

- **Used to update or replace** an existing resource.
- The request body contains the **complete representation** of the resource being updated.
- **Idempotent**: Calling a **PUT** request multiple times with the same data won't change the result (the resource remains the same).

### **PUT Request Example**:

```HTTP
PUT /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com 
Content-Type: application/json  
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "John Doe",   
		"email": "john.doe@example.com" 
	}
```

- This sends data to update the user with **ID 1**. If this request is made again with the same data, the result will be the same.

### **PUT Response**:

- **200 OK**: Usually returned when the resource is updated successfully.
- The server may return the updated resource in the response body.

### **PUT Response Example**:

```JSON 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
Content-Type: application/json  
	{   
		"id": 1,   
		"name": "John Doe",   
		"email": "john.doe@example.com" 
	}
	
```

### Key Points:

- **PUT** is for **updating/replacing** an existing resource.
- **Request** contains the full resource to be updated.
- **Response** typically includes the updated resource or a confirmation.
