### Q:  what will generate after write this: 
```cs

@model MyViewModel @Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.Description, new { @class = "form-control", @rows = 5 })
```

When you write the following Razor syntax:

```csharp
@model MyViewModel @Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.Description, new { @class = "form-control", @rows = 5 })
```

Hereâ€™s what happens:

1. **`@model MyViewModel`**: This defines the model that the view is going to use, in this case, `MyViewModel`. This model class is expected to have a property called `Description`.
    
2. **`@Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.Description, new { @class = "form-control", @rows = 5 })`**:
    
    - `Html.TextAreaFor` is an HTML helper that generates a `<textarea>` element in the form.
    - `model => model.Description` refers to the `Description` property of the `MyViewModel` class. This property will be bound to the `<textarea>`.
    - The second argument `{ @class = "form-control", @rows = 5 }` is an anonymous object that provides additional HTML attributes for the generated `<textarea>`. In this case, it sets the class to `form-control` (commonly used in Bootstrap forms) and defines the number of rows for the textarea as 5.

### The generated HTML would look like this:

```html

<textarea class="form-control" rows="5" id="Description" name="Description"></textarea>
```


- `id="Description"`: The ID of the `<textarea>` is automatically set to the name of the property (`Description`).
- `name="Description"`: The name attribute is also set to `Description`, which is important for model binding during form submission.
- `class="form-control"`: The CSS class `form-control` is applied, making the textarea styled according to the Bootstrap framework (if included).
- `rows="5"`: Sets the number of rows displayed by the textarea to 5.

This is useful for creating a larger input field in forms, especially for descriptions or comments.
