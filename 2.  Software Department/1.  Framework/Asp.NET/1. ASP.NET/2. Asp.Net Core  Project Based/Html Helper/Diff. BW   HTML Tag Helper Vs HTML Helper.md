| Feature           | HTML Helpers                                               | Tag Helpers                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | Methods in Razor views that generate HTML markup directly. | Syntax in Razor that allows you to create HTML elements declaratively. |
| **Syntax**        | C# method calls (e.g., `@Html.TextBoxFor(...)`)            | HTML-like syntax (e.g., `<input asp-for="PropertyName" />`)            |
| **IntelliSense**  | Limited IntelliSense support in **views**.                 | Full IntelliSense support in **Razor views**.                          |
| **Context**       | Primarily used in ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core MVC.        | Introduced in ASP.NET Core, designed for both MVC and Razor Pages.     |
| **Ease of Use**   | Requires more typing and understanding of methods.         | More intuitive and concise, closer to standard HTML.                   |
| **Extensibility** | Can create custom helpers by writing methods.              | Easily extendable by creating custom tag helpers.                      |
|                   |                                                            |                                                                        |

### Examples

#### HTML Helper Example
```html title:razor_syntax
@Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.PropertyName)

```
- These are methods in C# (server-side) that generate HTML in Razor views.
- Syntax: They are used within `@` block in Razor views.


#### Tag Helper Example
```html  title:razor_syntax
<input asp-for="PropertyName" />

```
- Tag Helpers look like regular HTML tags but have additional attributes (like `asp-for`) to bind to model properties.
- They are designed to work more like HTML, providing a more natural and intuitive way to work with Razor pages.
- Introduced in ASP.NET Core, making it easier to write cleaner and more HTML-like syntax.

## Summary
- **HTML Helpers** are methods you call within your Razor views, while **Tag Helpers** provide a more intuitive, declarative syntax that resembles HTML. method-based and need `@Html`.
- **Tag Helpers** are preferred for their readability and better tooling support in modern ASP.NET Core applications.**Tag Helpers** extend normal HTML tags with additional functionality and look more like regular HTML tags.
