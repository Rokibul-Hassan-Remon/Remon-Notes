### Steps of the Migration Process in Visual Studio:

1. **Build Process**:
    
    - **Before** running **migration** commands like `Add-Migration` or `Update-Database`,
	   Visual Studio **starts** the **build process** to **compile your project.**
	   
    - If there are **errors** in the code (syntax issues, missing dependencies, etc.), 
     the **migration** won’t **proceed**, and you'll be shown the **build errors** in the
      **Output** or **Error List** window.

2. **Add Migration Command**:
    
    - Once the build succeeds, **EF(Entity Framework)** **Core** will look at your **model classes** (in your **DbContext** or other model folders) 
      to check if there are any **changes that need to be reflected** in the database schema.
      
    - It generates a new migration file in the **Migrations** folder, containing the `Up()` and `Down()` 
      methods that define how to update the schema and how to revert the changes.
      
3. **Migration Script**:
    
    - The script that runs during this time will typically indicate **"Build started"** followed by 
       various steps showing the compilation, migration generation, and then applying the 
       migration to the database.
       
    - The **Output** window in Visual Studio will show the detailed process of what’s happening.
