- **Why use "@" in Razor views for directives like `@model`?**
    
    - In `.cshtml` (Razor view files), `@` is a special symbol that tells Razor that what follows is C# code or a directive. While C# uses `using` to reference namespaces, Razor uses `@` for directives to keep it distinct from HTML. So, `@model` at the top of the view file tells Razor to expect a particular model type for the view, similar to the purpose of a `using` directive in C#, but it’s specific to Razor syntax.
- **Why "@" in front of single-line C# code in Razor?**
    
    - In Razor views, `@` indicates that the line contains C# code. This syntax helps Razor distinguish between HTML and C# code so it can switch context appropriately. So, if you use `@someVariable`, Razor knows it’s C# code and not plain text or HTML.

So, `@` in Razor helps create a bridge between HTML and C#, which is a unique need for Razor view files.
