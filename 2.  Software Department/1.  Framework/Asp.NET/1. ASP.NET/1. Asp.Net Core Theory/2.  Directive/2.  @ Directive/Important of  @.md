there’s a reason behind using `@` in Razor views—it’s essential for Razor’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">parsing (শব্দবিশ্লেষণ) </span> process.

Here’s why it’s necessary:

1. **Mixing HTML and C#:** Razor views are designed to allow you to blend HTML with C# code. Since Razor needs to know where HTML ends and C# begins, the `@` symbol acts as a clear marker to switch contexts.
    
2. **Parsing Efficiency:** When Razor processes a view, it reads line-by-line. The `@` symbol is a simple, unambiguous way for Razor to know, "This is where I need to execute C# code" versus "This is HTML." Without it, Razor would struggle to identify which parts are code versus plain HTML, causing errors and inefficiency.
    
3. **Single Syntax for Consistency:** Instead of having complex syntax rules, Razor relies on this single `@` convention to manage all code blocks, making it consistent and less confusing for developers. It’s simpler and easier to maintain across different types of expressions.
