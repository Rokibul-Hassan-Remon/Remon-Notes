Optimizing performances using C#🔥  
  
Welcome to our series' seventh and final post, where we introduce performance optimization techniques for creating and managing variables.  
  
When your code demands high performance, understanding how to optimize memory and reduce overhead becomes crucial. This post explores techniques like stack allocation, pointers, and object pooling, which are invaluable when working on performance-critical use cases. These techniques ensure your code runs efficiently without unnecessary memory allocations.  
  
Each technique is advanced enough to be the subject of its own post, so consider this an introduction.  
  
📝 Summary  
Here are key techniques you can use to optimize performance:  
  
- Stack allocation: Use Span<T> and stackalloc to allocate memory on the stack, improving performance compared to heap-allocated memory.  
- Pointers: Use unsafe pointers to access memory directly for highly optimized code. Be cautious since unsafe pointers bypass the runtime's memory safety features.  
- Fixed buffers: Inside unsafe code, fixed-size buffers offer control over memory layout by inlining the array with the rest of the struct instead of separately on the heap.  
- Object pooling: Leverage ArrayPool<T> to reuse arrays, almost negating the cost of array creation.  
- ref struct: Creates the struct on the stack instead of the heap, avoiding heap allocations and ensuring better performance.  
- Span<T>: Provides performant access to existing memory blocks (e.g., arrays, stack-allocated, or unmanaged memory) while avoiding unnecessary allocations and garbage collection overhead.  
- Memory<T>: Similar to Span<T> without the limitations because it can be stored on the heap, making it ideal when memory needs to persist beyond the current frame.  
- in parameters: Pass a struct by reference without copying it, ensuring read-only access.

🔑 Important  
To allow unsafe code to run, you must explicitly allow it, for example, by adding `<AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>` in your .csproj file.

You may never need any of those techniques, yet it's essential to know they exist for the day you do!
