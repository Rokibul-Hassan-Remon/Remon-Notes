## Levels Description[](https://github.com/hazemadelkhalel/Competitive-Programming-Library/blob/main/Road%20Map/README.md#levels-description)

These levels will help you improve in competitive programming, and they do not require you to have prior knowledge or experience in problem solving. The plan is currently under development and being tested by the FCAI ACM community.

There are 4 different levels and the requirements for them:

- [Level 0](https://github.com/hazemadelkhalel/Competitive-Programming-Library/blob/main/Road%20Map/Level%200.md): beginner with no prior knowledge or experience in competitive programming. The target of this plan is to be able to solve CF-div2 A(B) expected to be close to the pupil and can reach it.
    
- [Level 1](https://github.com/hazemadelkhalel/Competitive-Programming-Library/blob/main/Road%20Map/Level%201.md): has basic knowledge of most of the topics and good implementation skills. The target of this plan is to be able to solve CF-div2 AB(C) expected to be a stable pupil and can be a specialist.
    
- [Level 2](https://github.com/hazemadelkhalel/Competitive-Programming-Library/blob/main/Road%20Map/Level%202.md): know basic data structures such as STLs and good in some other techniques (Binary search, Static range queries, and sorting algorithms) also has good basic number theory and combinatorics. The target of this plan is to be able to solve CF-div2 ABC(D) expected stable specialist and can be an expert.
    
- [Level 3](https://github.com/hazemadelkhalel/Competitive-Programming-Library/blob/main/Road%20Map/Level%203.md): good in graphs and know most of graph traversal algorithms and learn some techniques such as basic dynamic programming (Knapsack - LCS - Coin change - LIS). The target of this plan is to be able to solve CF-div2 ABCD(E) expected stable expert.
    

Let's define something to measure how much time we trained and benefited. Rokba's day is a day at which you spending 14 hours in training and sleeping/eating/wasting time in 10 hours :). While this may not be practical for our everyday lives, it is important to establish a specific type of day that fosters a sense of progress. This definition of a day will be utilized in the plan.

Let's make an equation Rokba's Day = (1-3) of normal days.
