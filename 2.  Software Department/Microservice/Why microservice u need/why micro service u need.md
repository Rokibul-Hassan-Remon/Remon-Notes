Don't start with microservices. ‚ùå  
  
Even if you think your application will be big enough to justify it.  
  
And here's why. Microservices come with a premium:  
  
- Team coordination  
- Dealing with failure  
- Eventual consistency  
- Automating deployments  
- Managing multiple services  
- Provisioning additional infrastructure  
  
You don't need this complexity at the start of a new project.  
  
Does this bring value to your users? Most likely, no.  
  
If you can't manage a large monolith system, you won't do better with microservices.  
  
Your team's experience plays a significant role in building successful microservices.  
  
Here's a less risky strategy:  
  
- Start with a Monolith  
- Discover the service boundaries (bounded contexts)  
- Then decide if you need to break them into microservices  
  
Many other factors also play a role. I can't fit them all into one post.  
  
But I hope I've given you some food for thought.

Here's a contrarian take if you're up for a good discussion.  
  
Would you start a greenfield project with Microservices, and why?
