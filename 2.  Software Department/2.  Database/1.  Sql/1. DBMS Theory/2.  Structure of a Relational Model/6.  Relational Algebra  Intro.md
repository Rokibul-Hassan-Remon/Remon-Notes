<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Relational algebra</span> is a set of operations that manipulate relations (tables) to produce new relations. There are two types of operations:

1. **Unary Operations**: Work on one relation (e.g., **select**, **project**, **rename**).
2. **Binary Operations**: Work on two relations (e.g., **union**, **Cartesian product**, **set difference**).


### Key Operations

#### 1. Select Operation (σ)

- Selects tuples based on a condition.
- Example: To select instructors from the Physics department:
#     $$\sigma_{\text{dept\_name}=\text{"Physics"}}(instructor)$$
#### 2. Project Operation (Π)

- Returns specific attributes of a relation, eliminating duplicates.
- Example: To list IDs, names, and salaries of instructors:
#               $$\Pi_{\text{ID, name, salary}}(\text{instructor})$$

#### 3. Composition of Operations

- The result of one operation can be used as the input for another.
- Example: Find names of instructors in the Physics department:
#                   $$\Pi_{\text{name}}(\sigma_{\text{dept\_name} = \text{"Physics"}}(\text{instructor}))$$

#### 4. Cartesian Product (×)

- Combines tuples from two relations into one.
- Example: The Cartesian product of `instructor` and `teaches` relations results in a new relation combining their tuples.



#### 5. Join Operation (⋈)

- Combines tuples from two relations based on a condition.
- Example: To find information about instructors and the courses they taught: 
#            $$\sigma_{\text{instructor.ID} = \text{teaches.ID}}(\text{teaches X }\text{instructor})$$
### Set Operations

#### 1. Union (∪)

- Combines two relations, removing duplicates.
- Example: Courses taught in either Fall 2017 or Spring 2018: 
#   $$\Pi_{\text{course\_id}}(\sigma_{{\text{semester  }  =  \text{  "Fall"} \land \text{year  } = 2017}}(\text{section})) \cup \Pi_{\text{course\_id}}(\sigma_{\text{semester   } = \text{  "Spring"} \land \text{year  } = 2018}(\text{   section}))$$
#### 2. Intersection (∩)

- Finds tuples present in both relations.
- Example: Courses taught in both Fall 2017 and Spring 2018: 
#   $$ \Pi_{\text{course\_id}}(\sigma_{\text{semester} = \text{"Fall"} \land \text{year} = 2017}(\text{section})) \cap \Pi_{\text{course\_id}}(\sigma_{\text{semester} = \text{"Spring"} \land \text{year} = 2018}(\text{section})$$

#### 3. Set Difference (−)

- Returns tuples in one relation but not in another.
- Example: Courses taught in Fall 2017 but not in Spring 2018:

#   $$\Pi_{\text{course\_id}} \left( \sigma_{\text{semester} = \text{"Fall"} \land \text{year} = 2017} (\text{section}) \right) - \Pi_{\text{course\_id}} \left( \sigma_{\text{semester} = \text{"Spring"} \land \text{year} = 2018} (\text{section}) \right)$$
