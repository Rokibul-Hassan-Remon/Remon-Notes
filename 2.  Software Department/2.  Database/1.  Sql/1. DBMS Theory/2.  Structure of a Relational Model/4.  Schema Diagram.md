### Schema Diagrams

**Definition**: A database schema diagram visually represents the structure of a database. It illustrates the relations (tables), their attributes, primary keys, and foreign key dependencies.

### Schema Diagram Features

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Relation Representation**|Each relation is shown as a box with the relation name at the top.|
|**Attributes Listing**|Attributes of the relation are listed inside the box.|
|**Primary Key**|Primary key attributes are underlined within the box.|
|**Foreign Key Dependencies**|Arrows connect foreign key attributes in the referencing relation to the primary key in the referenced relation.|
|**Referential Integrity Constraints**|Other constraints (beyond foreign keys) are not explicitly shown.|

---

### Important Points

- **Primary Keys**: The primary key uniquely identifies each record in a relation (e.g., `deptname` in the Department relation).
- **Foreign Keys**: Foreign keys create a link between two relations. For example, `deptname` in the Instructor relation references `deptname` in the Department relation, establishing a relationship between instructors and their departments.
