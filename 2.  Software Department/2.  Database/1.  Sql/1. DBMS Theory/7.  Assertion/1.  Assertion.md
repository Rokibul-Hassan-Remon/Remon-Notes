**Assertion Introduction**:

- An **assertion** is a condition or rule applied to a database to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- It acts as a constraint, restricting database operations that would violate specific conditions.
- Assertions are used to maintain the validity of data by allowing only those modifications that meet defined criteria.
- They are especially important in databases where data accuracy and consistency are critical.
- Due to the potential for high processing demands, assertions should be used selectively and with careful consideration of system performance.

2. **Overhead of Complex Assertions**:
    
    - <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Testing complex assertions can introduce significant overhead to the system.</span>
3. **Careful Use of Assertions**:
    
    - <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Assertions should be used cautiously due to the potential overhead.</span>
4. **System Developers and Assertions**:
    
    - High overhead in testing and maintaining assertions has led some developers to either omit support for general assertions or to provide specialized, simpler assertions that are easier to test.
    - Most of the time people use trigger instead of assertion .
