**NVL** and **COALESCE** (for conditional casting):

- While not strictly casting functions, they help handle null values by providing alternate values, which can be useful in casting contexts.
- Example:
```sql

    
    SELECT NVL(CAST(column AS VARCHAR2(50)), 'Default Value') FROM table_name;
```
