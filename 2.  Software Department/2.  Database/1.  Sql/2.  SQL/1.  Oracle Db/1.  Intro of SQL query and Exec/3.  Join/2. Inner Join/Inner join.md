`Oracle` support only <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">inner join</span> :**`INNER JOIN`** requires you to explicitly specify the condition (`ON s.student_id = e.student_id`), 

## Natural Join: Only MySQL supports this 
**NATURAL JOIN** <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">automatically</span> joins based on all columns with the<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)"> same name in both tables</span>.

The relational algebra supports the left outer-join operation, denoted by ⟕θ, the right outer-join operation, denoted by ⟖θ, and the full outer-join operation, de noted by ⟗θ. It also supports the natural join operation, denoted by ⋈,aswellas the natural join versions of the left, right and full outer-join operations, denoted by ⟕,⟖,and⟗.The definitions of all these operations are identical to the def initions of the corresponding operations in SQL, which we have seen in Section 4.1
