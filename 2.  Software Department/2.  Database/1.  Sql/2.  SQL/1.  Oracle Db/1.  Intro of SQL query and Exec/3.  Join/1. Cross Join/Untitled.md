The relational algebra supports
the `Cross-join` operation, denoted by <span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)">X</span>. 
the `left outer-join `operation, denoted by <span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)">⟕θ</span>,
the `right outer-join` operation, denoted by <span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)">⟖θ</span>,
the `full outer-join` operation, de noted by <span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)">⟗θ</span>. 
 the`natural join` operation, denoted by<span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)"> ⋈</span>,
 the `Inner-join` operation, denoted by <span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)"></span>.<span style="color:rgb(255, 31, 218)"> ⋈</span>

as well as the natural join versions of the left, right and full outer-join operations, denoted by ⟕,⟖,and ⟗.

The definitions of all these operations are identical to the definitions of the corresponding operations in SQL, which we have seen in Section 4.1
