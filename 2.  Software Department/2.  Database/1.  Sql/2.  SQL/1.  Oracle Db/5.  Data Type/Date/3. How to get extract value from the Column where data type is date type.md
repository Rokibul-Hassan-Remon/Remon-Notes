That's the way to get the specific column



```sql

SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS month,
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS day,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS hour,
    EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS minute,
    EXTRACT(SECOND FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS second,
    EXTRACT(TIMEZONE_HOUR FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS timezone_hour,
    EXTRACT(TIMEZONE_MINUTE FROM SYSTIMESTAMP) AS timezone_minute
FROM dual;


```
