**Dropping the `Dollars` Type Itself**

- To remove the `Dollars` object type entirely from the database (e.g., if itâ€™s no longer needed), you need to first ensure that no tables or other database objects are using it. If any tables are still referencing `Dollars`, you must either drop those tables or modify them to remove the `Dollars` type dependency.

```sql
drop type dollar;

```
