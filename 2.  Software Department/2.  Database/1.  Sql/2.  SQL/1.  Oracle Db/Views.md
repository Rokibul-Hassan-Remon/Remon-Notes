***Views in SQL*** are a kind of **virtual table.** 
A view also has **rows** and **columns** like **tables**, but a view **doesn’t** store data on the **disk** like a **table**. 
View defines a **customized** query that **retrieves** data from one or more **tables, and represents** the **data** as if it was coming from a **single source**.
