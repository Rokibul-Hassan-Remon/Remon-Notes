1. **FROM** (  `scan tales`  )
2. **JOIN** (`marge tables` )
3. **WHERE** (`applies` the `filtering`)
4. **GROUP BY** (`groups rows` if specified)
5. **HAVING** (`filters  groups`  )
6. **SELECT** (`fetches` the `columns`)
7. **Distinct**(`Eliminate` the `duplicity`)
8. **ORDER BY** (`sorts` the `result`)
9. **LIMIT** (`limits/skips rows`)
10. **OFFSET** (  `skips rows`  )

Let me know if you need further explanation on any part of this!

আর `DML` এর সাধারণ বৈশিষ্ট্য হলো: `প্রথমে table` কে **খুজে বের করা** হয়

Here's the **complete list of SQL clauses** and their **order of execution** (logical order) when a query is processed by the database engine:

1. **FROM**
    - The first step is determining which tables or views the query will pull data from. This is where table joins are processed if applicable.
    
1. **JOIN**
    
    - If there are any joins (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc.), they are processed next, combining data from the relevant tables.
    
1. **ON**
    
    - This specifies the condition for the `JOIN`. Rows from different tables are combined based on this condition.
    
1. **WHERE**
    
    - After the tables are joined (if applicable), the `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows based on conditions specified.
    
5. **GROUP BY**
    
    - The result set is then grouped based on one or more columns. This is typically used with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.
6. **HAVING**
    
    - The `HAVING` clause filters the groups created by `GROUP BY`. It is similar to `WHERE` but works on grouped rows rather than individual rows.
7. **SELECT**
    
    - The `SELECT` clause comes next. After filtering, grouping, and having, it selects the specified columns or expressions from the remaining rows.
8. **DISTINCT**
    
    - If the `DISTINCT` keyword is used, it removes duplicate rows from the result set.
9. **ORDER BY**
    
    - The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the final result set in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns.
10. **LIMIT** (or **OFFSET**)
    
    - Finally, if the `LIMIT` clause (or `OFFSET`) is used, it restricts the number of rows returned by the query, or skips a specified number of rows.





```SQL
			SELECT  
						column1, COUNT(column2)
			FROM 
						table1
			JOIN 
						table2 
			ON 
						table1.id = table2.id
			WHERE table1.status = 'active'
			GROUP BY column1
			HAVING COUNT(column2) > 5
			ORDER BY column1 ASC
			LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```
